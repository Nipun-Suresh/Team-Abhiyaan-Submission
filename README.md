**Why I want to work in the team:**
------------------------------------
I am really interested in getting into AI.
When I saw that the Abhiyaan team focuses on such a relevant application of AI, it really motivated me to join the team.
I am really happy that it gives an oppurtunity to work in these subfields to students of any batch.
Also, as a student of Electrical Engineering, Abhiyaan gives a lot of exposure in those fields too.
I am excited as it is a holistic and all-round experience.
