**Why I want to work in the team:**
------------------------------------
I am really interested in getting into AI.\
When I saw that the Abhiyaan team focuses on such a relevant application of AI, it really motivated me to join the team.\
I am really happy that it gives an oppurtunity to work in these subfields to students of any batch.\
Also, as a student of Electrical Engineering, Abhiyaan gives a lot of exposure in those fields too.\
I am excited as it is a holistic and all-round experience.

Note
-------------
Answers to all questions have been uploaded as files in the repository.\
1. 'Q2,Q3 c++ codes' contain .cpp files (C++ code) for questions A2 and A3, which are linked and are hence placed in a folder together\
2. For the questions involving ROS alone, code has been uploaded twice. Once as just C++ code,\
another time in the 'ROS Packages' folder, which contains the nodes along with CMake and package.xml files
